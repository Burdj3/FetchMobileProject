A take home test for me to complete

The email I recieved told me to code in Kotlin, while the actual problem statemnt said Java OR Kotlin. I do all my work in Java, but decided I'd rather be safe than sorry, so learned some Kotlin real quick to code this in Kotlin. If there are any wierd quirks, that would be why.

## Problem Statement:
Display this list of items to the user based on the following requirements:

Display all the items grouped by "listId"
Sort the results first by "listId" then by "name" when displaying.
Filter out any items where "name" is blank or null.
The final result should be displayed to the user in an easy-to-read list.
